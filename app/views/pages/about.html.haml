  %p.fs-5.text-light= "I'm a full stack web developer with a background in education and customer service. I love learning new things and finding the best tools to solve problems related to web development. I got into web development because of my natural curiosity and drive to learn. I was teaching English in Thailand, and decided to take Harvard's CS50 on edX in my free time, and I enjoyed it so much that I decided to pursue web development as a full-time career."
  %p.fs-5.text-light= "My first full-stack web development project was to build a Shopify-based website for a local business called Staunton Dyes. I ensured that the client's requirements were met by listening, asking clarifying questions, and doing research to find the best option when I encountered an unfamiliar problem. I developed a method for the client to sell custom orders through the website and created ways for him to make changes to the wording and images as his business grows. I also integrated the error monitoring system with my phone and automated daily database backups to minimize risk for the client and create a seamless experience for customers."
  %p.fs-5.text-light= "Recently I have been working on a website called InfoCompass. It uses the Arxiv and MediaStack APIs to connect users with research papers and news articles about topics they're interested in. This saves time for users by automating searches and also allows them to track and store notes about articles they have read. I'm looking forward to continuing to learn as I begin my career as a full-stack web developer."
